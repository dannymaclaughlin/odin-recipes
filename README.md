currently towards the end of the javascript portion of foundations but am going back to complete this as the odin project updated the curriculum to add these projects after i had finished the html and css sections of foundations. not sure how much i remember but this will be a good refresher.

just finished the recipes project. took a day off because i caught covid but i was able to complete the html portion of the project and add css(which was optional). this is the most complete website i've done thus far.
