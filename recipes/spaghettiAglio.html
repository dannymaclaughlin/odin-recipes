            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> Muggine bottarga (cured mullet roe) is an ancient traditional food from the island of Sardinia in Italy. 
            I have enjoyed this treat for so many years I just had to share it with you. A classic pasta dish from Italy 
            becomes a specialty by adding bottarga to it. Enjoy!
            </p>
            

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 red chile pepper, seeded and minced</li>
                <li>2 ounces grated Sardinian mullet bottarga, divided</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
                <li>1 small lemon, zested</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add garlic to the oil and cook until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and stir together, reducing the temperature to medium-low. Continue stirring. The garlic should never become dark brown or crispy. If this has happened, the garlic is burnt and no longer appropriate for consumption.</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta, reserving at least 1 cup pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the oil mixture, still on medium-low heat. Stir or toss until all the spaghetti is well coated. Add 3/4 of the bottarga and stir to mix with the spaghetti, adding the reserved pasta water to hydrate as needed. There should be a little "sauce" when serving but not soupy.</li>
                <li>Divide onto 4 plates and sprinkle with chopped parsley and lemon zest; squeeze lemon juice over and sprinkle remaining bottarga on top right before serving.</li>
            </ol>
